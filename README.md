# Interactive Development 200 Term 1 - Crypto Compare

## About the Project

The "Crypto Compare" project is a comprehensive data-driven web application aimed at facilitating the comparison of various cryptocurrencies. Leveraging modern development technologies such as Node.js and React, the application integrates the Charts.js framework for advanced data visualization. This project serves as a practical application to explore and analyze intricate cryptocurrency data sets in a user-friendly and informative manner.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following software installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following commands:

npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
npm i react-router-dom
npm i axios


## Features and Functionality

The "Crypto Compare" application offers the following key features:

1. **Landing Dashboard:** Presents a comprehensive overview and breakdown of the most relevant properties of the selected cryptocurrency data set, using interactive Chart.js elements to visualize data.

2. **Comparison Page:** Includes a dedicated page for comparing two distinct objects from the data set. It utilizes Bar, Pie, and Radar or Polar Area charts to outline and compare the properties of the selected objects.

3. **Timeline Page:** Displays a dynamic Line Graph that maps the entries of at least 5 different properties across the entire dataset. The timeline is interactive and allows users to change the displayed property via an input.

## Concept Process

The development process involved the following stages:
